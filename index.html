                    <h4>Software Engineer (AI/ML) at Mercedes Benz Research and Development India (MBRDI)</h4>
                    <p><em>May 2021 – Present</em></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Customer Support Chatbot:</strong> Developed and deployed an intelligent customer support chatbot designed to provide users with direct answers to common queries. Utilized LLM, LangChain, LangGraph, and Python/FastAPI to understand user intent and retrieve relevant information from knowledge bases. This initiative successfully automated responses, leading to a reduction in Level 1 (L1) support ticket volume by over 60%.</li>
                        <li><strong>Raggle Chatbot Platform:</strong> Served as a key contributor in the design and end-to-end development of "Raggle," a scalable platform for building custom AI assistants. Responsibilities included both frontend (ReactJS) and backend (Python, FastAPI) engineering. Integrated advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and connected diverse data sources (documents, Confluence, Jira, PostgresDB) using LangChain. This initiative led to a significant 70% reduction in development and deployment time for AI assistants, enhancing workflow efficiency across more than five internal departments.</li>
                        <li><strong>DS onsite App:</strong> Contributed to developing a mobile application for real-time checks on the vehicle production line. Focused on backend development (Python, FastAPI) and seamless API integration with the central production planning application. Leveraged LLMs to enhance Driver Safety (DS) features, ensuring regulatory compliance and boosting process efficiency using Python, FastAPI, LLMs, and PostgresDB.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shodana - AI Drawing Verification:</strong> Designed and developed "Shodana," an AI-driven system automating the verification of engineering drawings against stringent compliance standards. Successfully cut manual verification time by over 50%, ensuring adherence to industry regulations. Collaborated closely with a cross-functional team to refine detection algorithms using Python, computer vision libraries (ultralytics/YOLOv8).</li>
                        <li><strong>Seat Belt Warning System (POC):</strong> Developed a Proof of Concept for an advanced real-time seatbelt warning system. Applied computer vision models (MoveNet, YOLOv8 via Python/ultralytics) for enhanced vehicle safety through occupant and seatbelt status detection. Achieved a 15% improvement in system accuracy through iterative refinement and hyperparameter tuning.</li>
